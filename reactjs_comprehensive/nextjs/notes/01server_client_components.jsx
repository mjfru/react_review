/*
! Server Components
* All components in Next.js use server components...components that rendered on the server, not on the client's browser

Benefits:
  - Data fetching
  - Security
  - Caching
  - Bundle Size

! Client Components
* These use the browser's API and allow users to interact or manipulate the component directly.
! Client components must be marked, preferably at the top, use "use client" (yes, as a string like that).
