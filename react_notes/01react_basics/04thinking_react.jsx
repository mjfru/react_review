! Thinking in React
* Thinking in React is a Core Skill -- It's different from building applications in other ways!

What does this mean?
* You can recognize situations where to use appropriate hooks, components, data flow, etc.
* You think in state transitions, not element mutations.

? The Thinking in React Process:

1. Break the desired UI into components and establish the component tree.
2. Build a static version in React (without state!)
3. Think about state
  - When to use it
  - Types of state: local / global
  - Where to place each piece of state

4. Establish data flow:
  - One-way data flow
  - Child-to-parent communication
  - Accessing global state

* When you've mastered these, you'll be able to answer questions like:
  - How to break up a UI into components?
  - How to make some components reusable?
  - How to assemble UI from reusable components?
  - What pieces of state do I need for interactivity?
  - Where to place state?
  - What types of state can or should I use?
  - How do I make data flow through the application?
