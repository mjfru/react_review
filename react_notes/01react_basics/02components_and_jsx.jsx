/*
! Components
* Components are the most fundamental aspect of React; applications are made entirely out of them!
There is nothing that's not a component inside of a React app.
* React takes components and 'draws' them onto a user interface, all these views it renders becomes what the user sees.
* Each has its own data, logic, and appearance.
! We build complex UIs by building multiple compnents and combining them together, like Lego pieces.
* Components can be reused, nested inside each other, and pass data between them.
Component trees are diagrams to visualize how they are linked to each other, parent/child relationships, etc.
