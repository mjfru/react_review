! Tailwind CSS
* "A utility-first CSS framework packed with utility classes like flex, text-center, and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup."
Utility-first CSS: Writing tiny classes with one single purpose and then combining them to build entire layouts.
* In Tailwind, these classes are already written for us; no new CSS but we're going to use some of Tailwind's hundreds of classes.

! The Good & Bad
* No need to worry about class names
* No jumping between files to write markup and styles
* Immediately understand styling in any other project that uses Tailwind.
* A design system: many design decisions have been made for you, making UIs look more consistent and better.
* Saves a lot of time, e.g. on responsive design.
* Docs and VS Code integration are tremendous

! Markup looks unreadable with lots of class names.
! Need to learn a lot of class names
! Need to install and set up Tailwind on each new project
! The feeling that you're "giving up" on vanilla CSS.
