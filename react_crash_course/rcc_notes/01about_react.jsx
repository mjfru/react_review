/*
! What is React & What Problem Does It Solve?
* React is a JS library for building user interfaces!
It's popular and a widely-sought after skill...but why??

* React is able to only change the small, changed pieces of the DOM instead of re-rendering the entire page.
* We only worry about the data in our app and 'reacts' to user input and changes in our UI.
