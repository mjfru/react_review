/*
TODO:
Your task is to edit the <button> in the App component such that the already defined handleCreateUser function is called with a value for name.

So you must not hard-code the value that should be assigned to user.name in the handleCreateUser function but instead pass it as a value for the name parameter when a click event on the <button> occurs.

You don't have to care about any value that might be entered into the <input> field - it's just there for decoration purposes.
